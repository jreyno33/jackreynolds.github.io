#Welcome to my website!
## A little about me
I am from Tucson, Arizona, and am currently 20 years old.  I came to Calpoly purely on a whim, my mom found it and we toured it, and I loved it! Now here I am two years into my time here at Calpoly, still loving it.  I am a Chemistry major and am interested in Biochemistry and Organic Chemistry.  I am currently doing research that is more involved in Biochemistry, it is hard but I enjoy my time there.  I do a lot of different things, I golf, do some Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, I play piano and guitar, and rock climb when I can.  I love sports and music and have always had a huge passion for both of these worlds.  Chemistry is something I wanted to do because it was the only topic I was ever interested in in high school, everything else in school was pretty boring to me.  I also despise work which is counterintuitive because being a STEM major implies a major workload.  I get by, but barely.  I think I am a pretty fun person and love being around people, so make sure to say hi if you ever see me.
